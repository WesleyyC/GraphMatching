# Spatial Pattern Recognition

This is an MATLAB OOP implementation of ARGs spatial pattern matching using a probabilistic parametric model.

In many application domains, structured information is very important and therefore recognizing the same structure can be very useful. However, to extract and summarize a specific pattern in a model in order to recognize a new one can be challenging.

In this project, we build a probabilistic parametric model from multiple ARGs, during which a sptial pattern can be detected and summarized automatically. This model then can be use to detect the similar pattern in the new test ARG.
