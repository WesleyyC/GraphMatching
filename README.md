# GraphMatching

To understand different methologies of different neurons, we want to cluster neurons with different images. To cluster image data, we need to do graph matching. However, graph matching is a NP problem, so a lot of algorithms are derived to get an approximated solution in a reasonable time.

According to Gold and Rangarajan, a graduated assignment algorithm is developed to solve the problem efficiently and the code here is an attemp to implment and improve their algorithm mentioned in their paper: https://www.cise.ufl.edu/~anand/pdf/pamigm3.pdf
